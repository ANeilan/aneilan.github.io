Hey, I'm Alan Neilan

I'm a security researcher when i'm not at my day job, hoping to eventually make it into a security role at some point.

You can typically find me on twitter at [@aneilan](https://twitter.com/aneilan), and on keybase at [@w00dsman](https://keybase.io/w00dsman)

This blog is going to mostly be my ramblings and what i decided on using to sort this out:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wondering where to make a blog that's basically just "crap I found on the internet", detailing the phishing stuff and hosting information /  stuff that may not be able to fit in one tweet
</p>&mdash; Alan Neilan (@aneilan) <a href="https://twitter.com/ANeilan/status/1188310492101709825?s=20">Oct 27, 2019</a></blockquote><br/>

[I also have a ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/alanneilan) if you care to check it out and throw a few bucks my way.
