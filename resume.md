## Security Researcher | Blog: aneilan.github.io | Massachusetts, United States

##### Currently employed as a Threat Analyst, my passion is security research and threat hunting which I currently do in my spare time. This can involve hunting for new phishing threats, analyzing malware, threat actor tracking and public speaking. Using data gathered during threat hunting, I then pivot and find additional threats targeting the same brand, or from the same threat actor. I am a member of multiple online forums, closed channels, and groups dedicated to security research and distributing information on evolving threats. The data I collect and distribute to impacted parties is used to quickly mitigate threats and take down attacker infrastructure.
