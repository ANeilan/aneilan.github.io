# Final blog post for now

Well, I'm still out of a security job for now. Though I have managed to get a part time job stocking shelves overnight (which really messes with one's sleep schedule, I gotta say). 

In any case, yesterday I checked on my old laptop and apparently the process I had running that dumped certificate transparency logs (certstream) to a file had errored out, and I hadn't checked it in a few days, which means I missed out on data for the 26th and 27th. I have decided to stop collecting certstream data for now. For anyone that wants to check out the data I have stretching back to June(ish) of 2019, this is the [Google Drive folder I set up to collect/organize it](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/191dw3z5NxPahP9mps1Z7l6mQn14Z-Y80). I think for the time being I'm going to put this blog on hold, since (as you probably noticed) I haven't updated it in a while.

Obviously, I'm still looking for a full-time Security job, preferably SOC Analyst or Security Analyst in the Massachusetts Area. Hoping that I can manage to get a Security job soon.

That's all for now, folks.
