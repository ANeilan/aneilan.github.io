# Been a while

Hey folks, it's been quite a while since I updated this blog.

I'm sure if you follow my twitter at all, you'll know that about two months ago, I finally started my new job. I've finally gotten a job in infosec.

I'm eventually going to get into some sort of schedule/routine or something and start putting more stuff up. 

Anyway, just letting y'all know I'm still alive. If you're going to be in Indianapolis for CircleCityCon, I'll be there. Probably going to be in vegas for defcon too
